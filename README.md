# BlenderBIM
Scripts and Plugins for the BlenderBIM plugin

This repo is a small collection of random scripts that I've used in the past to make my life easier using IFC.  Be careful before using them though, since they were written during the very early days of my coding journey :=).

I recommend checking the latest updates to BlenderBIM here: https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/tree/v0.7.0/src/blenderbim

These days, anything useful I come up with is committed directly to the main code repository ;).
